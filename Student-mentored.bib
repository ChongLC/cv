  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic social media has served as a channel of communication, venue for entertainment, and mechanism for information dissemination. OBJECTIVE: Due to growing and evolving social media utilization, this study aimed to assess the associations between social media usage patterns, demographics, and COVID-19 prevention guideline knowledge, perceptions, and self-reported adherence. METHODS: Quota sampled data were collected through an online survey of U.S. adults through the Qualtrics platform, from March 15th to 23rd, 2022, to assess covariates (e.g., demographics, vaccination, political affiliation), frequency of social media use, social media sources of COVID-19 information, as well as knowledge, perceptions, and self-reported adherence to COVID-19 prevention guidelines. Three linear regression models were employed for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1,043 participants responded to the survey, with an average age of 45.3, among which 49.4\% were male, 66\% white, 11.3\% Black, 13.1\% Hispanic/Latino, 36.7\% democrat, 29.4\% republican, and 25\% not vaccinated. After controlling for covariates, users of TikTok (ß= -0.31, P=.03, 95\% CI [-.06, -.02]) were associated with a lower knowledge of COVID-19 guidelines, users of Instagram (ß= -0.33, P=.02, 95\% CI [-.59, -.06]) and Twitter (ß= -0.28, P=.02, 95\% CI [-.53, -.05]) were associated with perceiving guidelines as strict, and users of Facebook ( ß= -0.23, P=.02, 95\% CI [-.42, -.043]) and TikTok (ß= -0.25, P=.04, 95\% CI [-.28, .12]) were associated with lower adherence to the guidelines (R2 .06 - .23). CONCLUSIONS: These results allude to the complex interactions between online and physical environments. Future interventions should be tailored to subpopulations in terms of their demographics and social media site usage. Efforts to mitigate misinformation and implement digital public health policy must account for the impact of the digital landscape on knowledge, perceptions, and level of adherence to prevention guidelines for effective pandemic control.}
